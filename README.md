# Inventory Management System

This project is a simple **Inventory Management System** created as part of the **Software Design Week 3** assignment at **BINUS University**. The system allows users to manage an inventory of items with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities. Data is stored persistently in a JSON file.

---

## Features

- **Add Item**: Add new items to the inventory with unique IDs.
- **View Items**: View all items currently in the inventory.
- **Update Item**: Update details of an existing item with ID validation to prevent duplicates.
- **Delete Item**: Remove items from the inventory by ID.
- **Data Persistence**: All data is saved to and loaded from a JSON file.

## Implementation

The system is implemented using two programming paradigms:

1. **Procedural Programming**:
   - A straightforward approach focusing on step-by-step procedures.
   - Suitable for small-scale systems with limited complexity.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
   - Modular design with encapsulated data and behaviors.
   - Easier to scale and maintain for larger systems.
